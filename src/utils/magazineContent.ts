      <h2>Nigeria's Youth Entrepreneurship Revolution</h2>
      
      <p><em>In this special issue, we dive into the stories, challenges, and triumphs of the next generation of Nigerian business leaders, exploring how they are shaping the future of the country's economy and culture.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>BY MERIT IKECHIKWU</strong></p>
      
      <p>They say the streets are tough, the economy is unpredictable, and the job market is tighter than a closed fist. But if there's one thing young Nigerians have mastered, it's turning pressure into diamonds.</p>
      
      <p>Welcome to the new hustle code—where youth entrepreneurship isn't just a backup plan, it's the plan.</p>
      
      <h3>FROM SIDE HUSTLE TO MAIN MISSION</h3>
      
      <p>For years, "What do you do?" was a simple question. Today, it's layered. A typical answer sounds more like, "I'm a digital marketer, I run a thrift store on Instagram, and I'm building a skincare line on the side." Nigerian youth are not waiting for opportunities—they're building them.</p>
      
      <p>The post-pandemic era, fueled by rising internet access and social media platforms, opened a floodgate of innovation. Instagram stores, TikTok marketing, WhatsApp business catalogs, virtual assistants, and online tutoring are now thriving industries. Gen Z and Millennials are no longer thinking "get a job"—they're thinking "create one."</p>

      <h3>WHY THIS SHIFT MATTERS</h3>
      
      <p>The stats don't lie. With over 60% of Nigeria's population under 30 and a youth unemployment rate that's nothing short of alarming, entrepreneurship has become the solution—not the last resort.</p>
      
      <p>What makes this wave special isn't just the businesses—it's the mindset. Today's young entrepreneurs are problem-solvers. They're asking, "How can I make money and still create value?" That's why we're seeing businesses that are both profitable and purpose-driven—from eco-friendly packaging brands to tech startups solving real social issues.</p>

      <h3>THE DIGITAL ADVANTAGE</h3>
      
      <p>Social media isn't just for trends and memes anymore—it's a launchpad. A Twitter thread can get a client, a TikTok video can go viral and lead to brand deals, and an Instagram reel can sell out a product overnight. Digital skills like content creation, SEO, graphic design, and coding are now essential tools in the Nigerian entrepreneur's toolbox.</p>
      
      <p>John Oseni is a young Nigerian tech prodigy and full-stack developer known for building powerful digital solutions across Africa.</p>
      
      <p>Even better? Most of these skills are self-taught. Platforms like YouTube, Coursera, and even free Twitter classes have become the new classrooms.</p>

      <blockquote>"As a digital entrepreneur, I've harnessed the power of social media and online platforms like Instagram and TikTok to grow Sadeeybakes_abj beyond physical boundaries. The digital space has given me the advantage of reaching a wider audience, building a loyal customer base, and showcasing my products in creative and engaging ways. From online marketing to virtual orders and customer engagement, digital tools have played a key role in shaping the visibility and success of my business. But I must say, consistency is key in every business—even with the use of digital tools." —Sadeey Uba</blockquote>
      
      <blockquote class="text-center text-xl font-serif">"BORN IN THE HUSTLE, RAISED BY RESISTANCE, WE'RE THE SUNRISE AFTER EVERY STORM"</blockquote>
      
      <h3>THE REAL CHALLENGES</h3>
      
      <p>Let's be real. It's not all vibes and business wins. Many young entrepreneurs still face huge barriers: poor access to funding, limited mentorship, infrastructure challenges, and sometimes, discouragement from society. Not everyone understands the hustle at first.</p>
      
      <p>But here's what's amazing: they keep going. They pivot, rebrand, restock, and repost until it works. That resilience? That's the real Nigerian spirit.</p>
      
      <h3>WHAT'S NEXT?</h3>
      
      <p>The future of Nigeria lies in the hands of these innovators. Imagine if youth entrepreneurs had more structured support: government grants that actually reach them, access to low-interest loans, shared workspaces, skill hubs, and mentorship networks.</p>
      
      <p>We're already seeing micro-accelerators and community-based incubators popping up in places like Lagos, Enugu, and Kaduna. It's just the beginning.</p>
      
      <h3>FINAL THOUGHTS</h3>
      
      <p>Youth entrepreneurship in Nigeria isn't just a trend—it's a movement. It's redefining success, reshaping the economy, and proving to the world that when given the right tools (or even without them), Nigerian youth will find a way to win.</p>

      <h2>S.H.E.E.P: Superior Humans Elevating Everyone's Potential</h2>
      
      <p>In a world where style is often just about looking good, SHEEP dares to be different. It's not just another streetwear label—it's a bold declaration, stitched into cotton and culture. With a name that flips the narrative on its head, SHEEP stands for Superior Human Elevating Everyone's Potential—a mission, a mindset, and a movement.</p>
      
      <p>Born from the streets, inspired by purpose, and designed for elevation, SHEEP is where fashion meets inner greatness.</p>
      
      <blockquote>"True strength is quiet. Real power lifts others. SHEEP isn't meek, it's mighty."</blockquote>
      
      <h3>Flipping the Script</h3>
      
      <p>Traditionally, the word "sheep" evokes images of conformity, of blindly following the herd. But this brand reclaims and redefines it. In the SHEEP universe, to be a sheep is to be superior not above others, but within yourself. It's about elevation—lifting yourself while pulling others up with you.</p>
      
      <p>Every hoodie, tee, or cap isn't just a fit; it's a conversation starter, a mindset check. It says: I see greatness in myself, and I see it in you too.</p>
      
      <h3>The SHEEP Philosophy</h3>
      
      <p>The mission behind SHEEP is rooted in one idea: potential is collective. True elevation isn't about one person winning—it's about the whole crew rising together. Whether you're on the come-up in tech, music, art, or just figuring life out, SHEEP is your armor and anthem.</p>
      
      <blockquote>"We want people to wear purpose," says the founder. "Not just wear us for the look, but for what it represents: self-awareness, community, and unstoppable growth."</blockquote>
      
      <h3>SHEEP Is the New Roar</h3>
      
      <p>In a world chasing clout, SHEEP is chasing calling. It's not here to follow trends. It's here to start waves. For every superior human out there quietly grinding, growing, and elevating, this brand was made for you.</p>
      
      <p>So the next time you throw on a SHEEP hoodie, remember: you're not just wearing a name—you're wearing a purpose.</p>
      
      <h3>A Message from Bashir Suleiman</h3>
      
      <p>Welcome to SHEEP where streetwear meets purpose, and fashion becomes a movement. This isn't just a collection; it's a call to action. SHEEP stands for Superior Human Elevating Everyone's Potential, and it's designed to remind you: you're not just wearing clothes, you're wearing a mindset.</p>
      
      <p>Created in collaboration with Unfold, SHEEP is our way of sparking change, of inspiring you to unlock the potential within yourself and those around you. It's about creating a ripple effect of growth, empowerment, and community. Imagine a world where every interaction is a chance to lift someone up, where style meets substance, and where everyone has the tools to be their best selves.</p>
      
      <p>That's the world SHEEP is building. From bold puffer jackets to gender-fluid vests, every piece is a statement: you are a leader, a visionary, a SHEEP. So, are you ready to join the movement? To elevate, to inspire, to unlock the extraordinary in the ordinary? Wear SHEEP. Be the hero. Change the game.</p>

      <h2>Afrobeats to the World: The Evolution of Nigerian Music</h2>
      
      <p><strong>BY SHAHID ABDULLAHI</strong></p>
      
      <p>It started as a drumbeat in the dust, a whisper in the wind. Now, it's a tidal wave crashing on global shores. From smoky Lagos nights to neon-lit world stages, Afrobeats didn't arrive. It erupted.</p>
      
      <blockquote>"Afrobeats is freedom—a sound that lets me be raw, real, and fully myself." — Tems</blockquote>
      
      <p>You hear that rhythm? That's not just a beat—that's history in motion. Nigerian music has gone from smoky dance halls in Lagos to headlining stadiums in London, LA, and Tokyo. From Fela's fearless anthems to Tems on a Black Panther soundtrack, Afrobeats isn't trending—it's taking over.</p>
      
      <p>In this piece, we trace the journey from local sound to global takeover. This is not just a vibe—this is Afrobeats to the world.</p>
      
      <h3>"If you no gree dance, you go gree nod your head."</h3>
      
      <p>That's the law when Nigerian music hits your ears. From dusty speakers in Surulere to sound systems in New York clubs, Afrobeats has become a force—not just a sound, but a global language.</p>
      
      <p>But how did we get here?</p>
      
      <h3>From Highlife to Hype</h3>
      
      <p>Before the "Afro" came with "beats," Nigeria had a rich musical legacy. Highlife, juju, and fuji ruled the airwaves. Legends like King Sunny Ade and Ebenezer Obey were the original rockstars, and they did it in agbadas.</p>
      
      <h3>Then came Fela Anikulapo Kuti.</h3>
      
      <p>A rebel, a genius, and the founding father of what we now recognize as Afrobeat (with no "s"). His fusion of jazz, funk, and fierce political lyrics changed the game. Fela didn't just make music—he made movements.</p>
      
      <h3>Enter the Afrobeats Era (With an "s")</h3>
      
      <p>Fast-forward to the late 2000s. A new generation was rising. D'banj, Wande Coal, P-Square, and 9ice brought swag, rhythm, and something new—digital beats, street vibes, and global energy.</p>
      
      <p>Then came the titans:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wizkid, the starboy who broke into the Billboard charts.</li>
        <li>Davido, with global collabs and massive anthems.</li>
        <li>Burna Boy, the African Giant who took home a Grammy and made sure the world put respect on our sound.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Afrobeats became more than music—it became identity.</p>
